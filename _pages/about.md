Welcome to my website! I'm currently a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Michigan, in the Department of Radiology, working with Dr. Jesse Hamilton. I was previously a graduate student in the Medical Biophysics department at UToronto, studying with Dr. Graham Wright and an undergraduate at UChicago studying mathematics.

Outside of medical physics, I am interested in computer hardware, homelab tinkering, Linux customization, photography, Broadway musicals, and Marvel movies. I play bass clarinet in the Hart House Symphonic Band and saxophone in local jazz jams. I am also a second-degree black belt in Tang Soo Do.
