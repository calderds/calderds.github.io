Welcome to my website! I'm currently a fourth-year graduate student in the Medical Biophysics department at UToronto, studying cardiac MRI in patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices with Dr. Graham Wright. I was formerly an undergraduate at UChicago studying mathematics.

Outside of medical physics, I am interested in computer hardware, homelab tinkering, Linux customization, photography, Broadway musicals, and Marvel movies. My amateur talents include playing saxophone and clarinet, speaking Chinese, and Tang Soo Do (second-degree black belt).
